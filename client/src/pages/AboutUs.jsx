              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                HotelEase was founded with a simple mission: to make finding and booking accommodations easier for
                travelers around the world. What started as a small project in Kathmandu, Nepal has grown into a
                platform connecting thousands of travelers with unique stays across the globe.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our journey began when a group of travel enthusiasts recognized the challenges of finding authentic,
                quality accommodations that matched their preferences and budget. We set out to create a solution that
                puts the traveler's experience first, combining technology with local expertise.
